# SimpleBackupManager
A simple backup manager made in python.
Made by Pob.

# What will it do?
When I've finished making it (provided I don't become lazy) it will backup files to a specific folder or drive of your choice. When you want to refresh it, it will update the files that have had changes, or it will create an entirely new backup, it's completely up to you!

# Please file any issues under the issues tab.
Yeah I know. Why am I putting this here? I don't know either.
